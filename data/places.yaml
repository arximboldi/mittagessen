#  Each entry describes a lunch option close to the Ableton
#  office. Each entry has the following required attributes:
#
#      name:    Name of the place
#      where:   link to a map to find the place
#      bg:      html color for the background of the page when
#               showing the plaec
#      fg:      html color for foreground elements
#
#  Each entry has the following optional attributes:
#
#      chance:  relative probability (default: 1. see algorithm)
#
#
#  Algorithm
#  ---------
#
#  The app uses a kind of "bucket probability distribution" for
#  choosing the place where to go.  You can think of it as throwing a
#  coin towards a set of buckets, each bucket representing an option.
#  Given all buckets having the same size, the coin has equal
#  probability to fall in each.  However, buckets have different
#  sizes, such that if a bucket is twice as big as another bucket, it
#  is twice as likely for the coin to fall in the bigger one.
#
#  This allows to control the relative probability of discrete events
#  without global parameters.
#
#  The bucket size for a place is controlled by the `chance`
#  parameter.  When unspecified, it defaults to `1`
